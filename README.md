“If you want to go somewhere, goto is the best way to get there.” Ken Thompson

“Now that I have discussed how to remove go to statements, I will turn around and show why there are occasions when I actually wish to insert them into a go to-less program. The reason is that I like well-documented programs very much, but I dislike inefficient ones; and there are some cases where I simply seem to need go to statements …” Structured Programming with go to Statements. Donald E. Knuth (Stanford University)
